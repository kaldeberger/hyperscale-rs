//! Radix Engine executor for deterministic simulation.
//!
//! This module provides synchronous transaction execution that can be called
//! by runners. The executor does NOT own storage - storage is provided by
//! the runner as method arguments.
//!
//! # Design Principle
//!
//! State machines emit `Action::ExecuteTransactions` and receive
//! `Event::TransactionsExecuted`. The runner owns the storage and executor,
//! calling the executor methods to handle these actions.
//!
//! **IMPORTANT**: The executor is READ-ONLY. It does NOT commit state changes
//! to storage. Writes are collected in the execution result and committed later
//! by the runner when a `TransactionCertificate` is included in a committed block.
//! This ensures all validators agree on the state before it's persisted.
//!
//! ```text
//! State Machine → Action::ExecuteTransactions { ... }
//!      ↓
//! Runner (owns storage + executor)
//!      ↓
//!      → executor.execute_single_shard(&storage, &transactions)  // READ-ONLY
//!      ↓
//! Runner → Event::TransactionsExecuted { results }  // results contain writes
//!      ↓
//! ... voting, certificate creation, block inclusion ...
//!      ↓
//! Runner → Action::PersistTransactionCertificate  // WRITES COMMITTED HERE
//! ```

///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Runner owns storage
/// let storage = Arc::new(SimStorage::new());
///
/// // Create executor (no storage parameter)
/// let executor = RadixExecutor::new(network);
///
/// // Run genesis (mutates storage)
/// executor.run_genesis(&storage)?;
///
/// // Execute transactions (reads/writes storage)
/// let output = executor.execute_single_shard(&storage, &transactions)?;
/// ```
///
/// # Simulation vs Production
///
/// - **Simulation**: Calls executor methods inline (synchronous, deterministic)
/// - **Production**: Spawns executor methods on rayon thread pool (async callbacks)
