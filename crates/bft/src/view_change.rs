//! View change component for liveness.
//!
//! Handles timeout detection and coordinated round increments when progress stalls.
//!
//! # HotStuff-2 QC Forwarding
//!
//! With the 2-chain commit rule, view change votes include the validator's `highest_qc`.
//! This ensures the new proposer learns about the highest certified block and can build
//! on it, preserving safety. The `highest_qc` is attached as **unsigned data** to allow
//! BLS signature aggregation.
//!
//! # Exponential Backoff
//!
//! View change timeouts use exponential backoff to prevent rapid repeated view changes
//! during network partitions or slow periods. The timeout doubles with each consecutive
//! view change at the same height, up to a maximum cap.
